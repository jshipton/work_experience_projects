### Introduction to Python
The `intro_to_python` notebook takes you through how to use python as a calculator and how to implement more complex iterative algorithms using loops and lists. It also contains a basic intro to plotting with matplotlib.

### Lorenz equations
The `lorenz equations` notebook contains some code to solve the [Lorenz equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) - you will need to complete some of the functions. Once you can produce plots of the solution, try:
1. Changing the parameters of the system (`sigma`, `r` and `b`).
2. Changing the initial condiitons of the system (`X0`).
3. Produce an ensemble forecast by running the model with randomly perturbed initial conditions and parameters. You may like to do this in a loop, using the [numpy random number generator](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html) to give you random values.

### Machine learning for subgridscale processes

Watch this online seminar: [Climate modelling in the age of machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH_A1nvwiDI)

Note down any words or concepts that you're not sure about.

Can you answer these questions?

1. What is a subgridscale process? Can you find some examples?
2. What is a parametrisation?
3. Why can't we run models at a higher resolution? How might machine learning help?
4. What does `interpretability' mean in the context of machine learning?
5. What is coarse graining?
6. What are the two approaches to using machine learning in weather and climate prediction that Laure describes? What are the pros and cons of each?
