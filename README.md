### Introduction to Python
The `intro_to_python` notebook takes you through how to use python as a calculator and how to implement more complex iterative algorithms using loops and lists. It also contains a basic intro to plotting with matplotlib.

### Lorenz equations
The `lorenz equations` notebook contains some code to solve the [Lorenz equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) - you will need to complete some of the functions. Once you can produce plots of the solution, try:
1. Changing the parameters of the system (`sigma`, `r` and `b`).
2. Changing the initial condiitons of the system (`X0`).
3. Produce an ensemble forecast by running the model with randomly perturbed initial conditions and parameters. You may like to do this in a loop, using the [numpy random number generator](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html) to give you random values.
