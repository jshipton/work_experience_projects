    "\n",
    "In this worksheet we will explore some key ideas underpinning the mathematical theory of _chaos_ and _predictability_.  In particular, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. consider the sensitivity of a solution to the initial conditions of the problem;\n",
    "2. examine the consequences of this for numerical simulation;\n",
    "3. learn about how to use scipy to compute results and matplotlib to plot them\n",

    "**Using the worksheet**\n",
    "- This is your own copy of this worksheet - feel free to edit it as you like (or save another copy to edit instead).\n",
    "- Double-click on cells to edit them.\n",

    "## The Lorenz equations\n",
    "\n",
    "To aid us in our study of chaos, we will work with a system of differential equations, called the [Lorenz equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system):\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{x} \\\\ \\dot{y} \\\\ \\dot{z} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma (y - x) \\\\ -x z + r x - y \\\\ x y - b z \\end{bmatrix} .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $x$, $y$ and $z$ are our coordinates in three-dimensional space, the dot represents the derivative with respect to time $t$, and $\\sigma$, $r$ and $b$ are the parameters of the model. A typical choice for these parameters is $\\sigma=10$, $r=28$ and $b=8/3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we cannot write down a closed formula for the solution of the Lorenz equations.  We can attempt to approximate the solution numerically, however, which we shall do in this worksheet using _Python_.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we import numpy, as we will be working with arrays."
